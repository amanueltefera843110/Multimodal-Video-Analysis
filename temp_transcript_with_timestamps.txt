[00:00:00] Man, what's up everybody? Welcome back
[00:00:03] to another episode of EOS. It's 1090J,
[00:00:06] man. I'm rocking with y'all and y'all
[00:00:07] rocking with me. And for this video,
[00:00:10] we're going to be speaking on some
[00:00:11] prehistoric paperwork that hit the
[00:00:14] internet that I'm not even responsible
[00:00:16] for, but I fact checked it. And in this
[00:00:19] video, we're gonna be speaking on Larry
[00:00:22] Hoover identifying two rival gang
[00:00:25] members to police that shot him. Tell
[00:00:30] him, bro. Who? Who? Free,
[00:00:32] bro. My mother he free. Who laughing?
[00:00:36] Hoover. He free
[00:00:42] bro. Free. They mad that we
[00:00:51] free them. Free Laroo. Now, President
[00:00:56] Trump just gave the presidential middle
[00:00:59] finger to anyone who ever called him
[00:01:01] racist after not only pardoning NBA
[00:01:04] Young Boy who's about to go on a mega
[00:01:06] tour, but commuting the sentence of the
[00:01:10] Larry Hoover. His name is Larry Hoover.
[00:01:13] He's the reputed leader of the black
[00:01:15] gangster Disciple Street gang, one of
[00:01:17] the largest in the nation. For 20 years,
[00:01:19] he's been locked behind prison walls
[00:01:21] because of a murder conviction. This
[00:01:23] week, he goes before the state parole
[00:01:25] board and he could soon be a free man.
[00:01:27] I've done my time. I I paid my debt to
[00:01:29] society. Anytime you do a do a stance at
[00:01:32] time amount of
[00:01:35] time, it could have two effects. It
[00:01:38] could harden you or it can make you
[00:01:40] think. and
[00:01:42] uh I have thought. Now, for those that
[00:01:45] don't know, Larry Hoover is the founder
[00:01:47] and former leader of the Gangster
[00:01:49] Disciples, a major street gang based in
[00:01:52] Chicago that spread from the Midwest,
[00:01:55] dominating parts of the South and even
[00:01:57] reaching out to the Northeast. To this
[00:02:00] day, many prominent rappers are members
[00:02:03] of the Gangster Disciples, while other
[00:02:06] rappers have been known sworn enemies to
[00:02:08] the Gangster Disciples. Larry Hoover, a
[00:02:12] kingpin, gang lord, murderer, is a man
[00:02:16] whose name has held power for over 50
[00:02:19] years. But today, his legacy is in
[00:02:22] question as the unthinkable has
[00:02:24] happened. Remo from No Jumper would post
[00:02:26] to Instagram a photo of what appears to
[00:02:29] be prehistoric paperwork, detailing a
[00:02:32] shooting in which Larry Hoover himself
[00:02:35] was the victim. Parker High School sat
[00:02:37] in the Englewood neighborhood on the
[00:02:39] south side of Chicago. On September 4th,
[00:02:43] 1968, it was the first day of school and
[00:02:46] it would be turned to a crime scene.
[00:02:48] Leader of the Supreme Gangsters,
[00:02:51] 18-year-old Larry Hoover, informed the
[00:02:54] police that he was standing in the
[00:02:56] school hall just outside the principal's
[00:02:58] office when two members of the East Side
[00:03:01] Disciples appeared. They were identified
[00:03:04] as 18-year-old James Highmith and
[00:03:06] 20-year-old Leonard Longreet, and they
[00:03:09] did not go to Parker High. Hoova told
[00:03:12] police the two walked past me in the
[00:03:14] hall and Highmith smiled. Then Long
[00:03:17] Street said, "Burn them." And Highmith
[00:03:20] pulled a gun and started shooting. I got
[00:03:22] hit. Larry Hoover, the 18-year-old
[00:03:26] leader of the Supreme Gangsters that
[00:03:28] came before the Gangster Disciples
[00:03:30] creation, flat out told the police two
[00:03:34] rival gang members entered his school
[00:03:36] and shot him. Bullets struck two other
[00:03:39] students, both 15 years old. Larry and
[00:03:42] the two others were all shot in the legs
[00:03:45] and rushed to a hospital. Only minutes
[00:03:47] after the shooting, police arrested the
[00:03:49] two gang members who were out on bond
[00:03:52] for two separate shootings. A Cook
[00:03:55] County grand jury would indict the two
[00:03:57] men on charges of aggravated battery on
[00:03:59] Larry Hoover. Now, this is going to piss
[00:04:02] a lot of people off. But before I do
[00:04:04] that, I wanted to confirm whether this
[00:04:07] was even true because this didn't seem
[00:04:09] to be an arrest report. This looked like
[00:04:12] a newspaper clipping. So, I dug into the
[00:04:15] Chicago Tribune dating back 57 years
[00:04:18] ago, and what I found was page 14 of the
[00:04:21] Chicago Tribune from September 5th,
[00:04:25] 1968, the day after the shooting. The
[00:04:29] article was titled, "Police Arrest Two
[00:04:31] in shooting of three students, gang
[00:04:34] rivalry blamed for violence." Three
[00:04:36] youths were shot down in Paka High
[00:04:38] School in what police described as a
[00:04:40] continuing battle between rival street
[00:04:42] gangs. Englewood police said the
[00:04:45] shooters were identified by the victims
[00:04:47] in the hospital and several other
[00:04:49] witnesses. The police identified Larry
[00:04:52] Hoover as a gang member. And again, the
[00:04:55] article would state Hoover told police
[00:04:58] who shot him and how it happened. Now,
[00:05:01] this would be considered snitching by
[00:05:02] anyone following the quote unquote code.
[00:05:06] But what about the one who created the
[00:05:08] code? This was Larry [ __ ] Hoover, the
[00:05:12] founder of the Gangster Disciples, a man
[00:05:14] whose name is at the top of Chicago gang
[00:05:17] lore along with Al Capone. And this
[00:05:20] wasn't the last time he'd be mentioned
[00:05:22] in a newspaper. Two years later, it was
[00:05:25] 1970 and Hoover was one of three
[00:05:27] arrested for gunning down a 19-year-old
[00:05:30] on 69th. 3 years after that, a
[00:05:34] 24year-old was kidnapped and shot to
[00:05:36] death. Hoover would be picked up on a
[00:05:38] murder warrant and a week later, a
[00:05:41] witness set to testify against Hoover
[00:05:44] was found dead on the south side with
[00:05:46] two holes in the back of his head. It
[00:05:49] was too late, though. The 26-year-old
[00:05:51] had already given a deposition to police
[00:05:53] stating he witnessed Hoover and another
[00:05:56] man kidnapped the victim the day before
[00:05:59] the victim was murdered. They dump his
[00:06:01] body in an alley allegedly because he
[00:06:04] was suspected of stealing drugs from the
[00:06:06] gang supply. This murder was what took
[00:06:09] Larry Hoover off the streets of Chicago
[00:06:12] at the age of 23. Deemed a ruthless
[00:06:15] killer who' been involved in multiple
[00:06:17] shootings and murders, Hoover was
[00:06:20] sentenced to 200 years in state prison.
[00:06:24] While inside, Hoover continued to lead
[00:06:26] the gangster Disciples, which led to a
[00:06:29] 17-year federal investigation. In 1995,
[00:06:34] Hoover was indicted by the feds from
[00:06:36] state prison and two years later
[00:06:38] sentenced to six federal life sentences
[00:06:41] for conspiracy, extortion, money
[00:06:44] laundering, drugs, and continuing to
[00:06:47] engage in a criminal
[00:06:49] enterprise. Larry Hoover ran the
[00:06:51] Illinois state prison system like a
[00:06:54] gangster disciple warden. So the feds
[00:06:57] took him where he'd be helpless,
[00:06:59] stripping him of all power. In prison
[00:07:02] since
[00:07:03] 1973, Hoover spent nearly 30 years at
[00:07:06] ADX Florence, the federal supermax. His
[00:07:10] neighbors would be terrorists, mass
[00:07:12] killers, and cartel leaders. His cell
[00:07:16] could only hold one man. A shower would
[00:07:18] be brought to his cell, and his male
[00:07:21] would be seen through a screen as
[00:07:23] physically touching it was too much of a
[00:07:25] privilege. Larry Hoover for the last 30
[00:07:28] years has been in a cold concrete hell
[00:07:32] until now. Trump commuted the sentence
[00:07:35] of Larry Hoover, which led many to
[00:07:37] believe Hoover was going to be a free
[00:07:39] man. But many fail to realize Hoover was
[00:07:42] serving 200 years before the Fed stepped
[00:07:45] in and he has to finish it. A
[00:07:48] bittersweet victory for those that know
[00:07:50] him as he's one step closer to home
[00:07:53] being now that he'll be back in
[00:07:54] Illinois. But at 78 years old, it isn't
[00:07:58] known how long he has to continue
[00:08:00] fighting for his freedom. One would
[00:08:02] assume he'd be treated like a god in
[00:08:04] Illinois state prison. The man is a
[00:08:07] Chicago legend, but one can also wonder
[00:08:10] why is it always when someone's about to
[00:08:12] be released, paperwork comes out of
[00:08:14] nowhere. We saw the same thing happen
[00:08:17] with Big Meech and how everyone
[00:08:20] including Meech thought he'd be welcomed
[00:08:22] home like royalty and instead the former
[00:08:25] drug lord is doing Instagram promo. But
[00:08:28] what about the GDS? How are they going
[00:08:31] to react to reading the clear black and
[00:08:34] white of Larry Hoover, the very founder
[00:08:37] of their beliefs, identifying the two
[00:08:40] rival gang members who shot him when he
[00:08:42] was 18? Does it not count because it was
[00:08:45] so long ago or because Hoover became so
[00:08:49] powerful? Nobody dared talk about his
[00:08:51] statement without the risk of being
[00:08:54] killed. As of May 29th,
[00:08:57] 2025, Larry Hoover is no longer in
[00:09:00] federal custody. And according to the
[00:09:02] Illinois Department of Corrections, he's
[00:09:05] been transferred to Dixon Correctional
[00:09:07] Center, a medium security prison.
[00:09:10] Hoover's current release date is October
[00:09:14] 25th,
[00:09:16] 2066. Now, I'm going to say this first
[00:09:19] and foremost, and with all due respect,
[00:09:21] if you weren't born in the 50s or the
[00:09:24] 60s, or are a direct relative of Larry
[00:09:27] Hoover, I don't give a [ __ ] what you
[00:09:30] have to say. Because if you're one of
[00:09:33] these GDs that's my age, 30 or younger,
[00:09:36] or even older, talking about why are you
[00:09:38] talking about it? He don't even know who
[00:09:40] the [ __ ] you are. This man's been in
[00:09:42] prison since
[00:09:43] 1973. So you can save all that gangster
[00:09:46] [ __ ] I don't want a bunch of pitchforks
[00:09:48] emojis on my [ __ ] Instagram. I don't
[00:09:51] give a [ __ ] to be honest.
[00:09:53] But it's very interesting that this
[00:09:56] paperwork came out of nowhere, right? I
[00:09:59] don't know who had this [ __ ] I don't
[00:10:01] know if the Stones was holding it. I
[00:10:02] don't know if somebody was waiting for
[00:10:04] it, right? But they literally waited
[00:10:06] until his sentence got commuted, which
[00:10:09] nobody expected. And then boom, this
[00:10:11] [ __ ] hits the internet. I didn't do it.
[00:10:13] I don't know where it came
[00:10:15] from, but I looked into it and yes, I
[00:10:18] found multiple articles detailing what
[00:10:21] took
[00:10:22] place and that's what happened. Larry
[00:10:25] Hoover got shot on his first day of
[00:10:27] school. He's most likely a senior since
[00:10:29] he was 18. Two rival gang members walked
[00:10:32] in the school and shot him out front of
[00:10:34] the principal's office. That's some
[00:10:36] gangster [ __ ] If this doesn't make you
[00:10:38] look at Chicago like, "Holy [ __ ] it's
[00:10:41] been like that forever." This was in the
[00:10:44] 60s. They're walking in schools with
[00:10:47] guns and popping off in the [ __ ]
[00:10:49] hallway. This [ __ ] was like that in the
[00:10:52] 60s. He got hit with a 32, which is
[00:10:54] probably why he survived. But then
[00:10:56] apparently Hoover went on a killing
[00:10:58] spree and was just smacking [ __ ] And
[00:11:02] um you got to understand Hoover got
[00:11:05] taken off the street at 23 years
[00:11:09] old. This man was a
[00:11:12] certified
[00:11:14] smacker
[00:11:16] leader. But unfortunately, if you go by
[00:11:19] the paperwork, he's also
[00:11:21] what? He'd be considered a snitch,
[00:11:24] right? He identified the two people that
[00:11:27] shot him and they were rival gang
[00:11:29] members and the police went to their
[00:11:32] house and got them. Now, he wasn't the
[00:11:35] only one that identified them, but he
[00:11:38] did. Um, and there's nothing that can
[00:11:41] really there's not an excuse for that.
[00:11:43] You know what I mean? There's nothing
[00:11:44] that somebody can say that's like
[00:11:46] huh cuz people will say all types of
[00:11:49] things snitching that's way less than
[00:11:52] what this is.
[00:11:54] I don't think there's a current rapper
[00:11:56] to this day that could identify the two
[00:11:58] people that shot him by name and say
[00:12:01] what gang they're a part of and not be
[00:12:03] shunned from hip
[00:12:06] hop. Like I said, I don't really give a
[00:12:09] [ __ ] though. Do I think the GDs are
[00:12:10] going to disown Larry Hoover? No. But
[00:12:14] I'm interested in seeing how this does
[00:12:16] play out because conversations are going
[00:12:18] to happen over this. This is the man
[00:12:20] that literally gave an entire
[00:12:26] nation basically their codes to live by.
[00:12:29] You know what I mean? And uh you know,
[00:12:32] Gangster Disciples Growth and
[00:12:34] Development, what it turned into is more
[00:12:35] so a positive movement, but it's a gang
[00:12:38] at the end of the [ __ ]
[00:12:40] day. We'll just have to see. Let me know
[00:12:43] y'all's thoughts in the comments
[00:12:45] section. I never knew you could get
[00:12:47] paperwork that goes this far back, but
[00:12:49] this is a documented shooting that took
[00:12:51] place. And you know, I have the news
[00:12:54] clippings in this video. Y'all can see
[00:12:56] it. Y'all can look it up for
[00:12:57] y'allselves. It ain't a secret. It's
[00:12:59] been out for [ __ ] 57 years. So, let
[00:13:04] me know y'all's thoughts in the comments
[00:13:05] section. It's 1090 Jake. I'm rocking
[00:13:08] with y'all or y'all rocking with me.
[00:13:10] Till next time.
