[00:00:00] for uh first of all, I want to thank you
[00:00:02] for that. That's beautiful. Thank you
[00:00:04] very much. Thank you again. Fantastic.
[00:00:06] We'll put it up in a place of honor. I
[00:00:09] don't know. Maybe we can uh let's see.
[00:00:11] We have to put it up there someplace. Uh
[00:00:14] it's an honor to have you. As you know,
[00:00:16] the chancellor just won a uh great
[00:00:19] election. Very, very strong
[00:00:21] election. Very respected man. I can tell
[00:00:24] you, we've been on the phone many times
[00:00:25] talking about some of the problems of
[00:00:27] the world outside of Germany.
[00:00:30] And uh it's very sad what what's going
[00:00:32] on. We both feel that way. Uh what's
[00:00:34] going on with Russia, Ukraine, and other
[00:00:38] things we talk about, but Russia,
[00:00:39] Ukraine in particular, I'd like to see
[00:00:41] it end and maybe it'll end, but uh we
[00:00:45] get some news there'll be some
[00:00:47] fighting. Something happened a couple of
[00:00:49] days ago and now they do a return and
[00:00:52] you know, here it goes. It's not good.
[00:00:54] He's unhappy about it. I'm unhappy about
[00:00:56] it. But uh I think eventually we're
[00:00:59] going to be successful in stopping the
[00:01:00] bloodshed. It's pure bloodshed. Five,
[00:01:02] six thousand young soldiers a week are
[00:01:06] being killed. You know that there's
[00:01:08] numbers there. We know the numbers.
[00:01:09] They're staggering. There staggering
[00:01:11] numbers. But Chancellor, I just want to
[00:01:13] congratulate you and I want to welcome
[00:01:15] you to the Oval Office. Thank you. It's
[00:01:17] an Oval Office that's in very good
[00:01:19] shape. We like fixing things up and
[00:01:22] having them tippy top like they have in
[00:01:23] Germany. Yeah, they do that in Germany
[00:01:26] very much and we do it here. Uh, we're
[00:01:29] having a very good run. We had a I also
[00:01:31] had a great election, great win. We won
[00:01:33] everything. Won the popular vote, the
[00:01:35] all seven swing states, which is a big
[00:01:37] deal. It's pretty unusual to do that and
[00:01:40] we have a great mandate from the people
[00:01:42] and uh part of our mandate is we're
[00:01:44] going to have a great relationship with
[00:01:46] your country. So, I just want to thank
[00:01:48] you very much for being here and uh if
[00:01:50] you'd like to say a few words.
[00:01:51] Absolutely. Oh, thank you first of all,
[00:01:54] Mr. President, for your kind invitation
[00:01:56] to come to Washington DC. I was in this
[00:01:58] building first time ever in 1982. I told
[00:02:01] you when former President Ronald Reagan
[00:02:04] was in office. So, I'm very happy to be
[00:02:07] here again and to offer our close
[00:02:09] cooperation with the United States of
[00:02:12] America. Uh we are having so much in
[00:02:15] common, our history. We owe the
[00:02:17] Americans a lot. We will never forget
[00:02:19] about that. And uh so with your German
[00:02:22] provenence, I think this is a very good
[00:02:24] basis for close cooperation between
[00:02:26] America and Germany. So again, thank
[00:02:28] you. Thank you for the hospitality and
[00:02:31] thank you for uh having your guest house
[00:02:34] for a night. This is a great place.
[00:02:37] Great place. Many thanks for that. I
[00:02:38] really enjoyed it. Thank you. It's a
[00:02:40] wonderful place. It's a landmark also.
[00:02:42] And Blair House is it's a nice place to
[00:02:45] stay. Thank you very much for saying
[00:02:47] that. Um, would you have any questions,
[00:02:50] please, Mr. President? On your new
[00:02:51] travel ban. Why now? And if the Boulder
[00:02:54] attack was part of your reasoning, why
[00:02:56] not include Egypt on that list where the
[00:02:58] suspect is from? Well, because Egypt has
[00:03:00] been a country that we deal with very
[00:03:02] closely. They have things under control.
[00:03:05] The countries that we have don't have
[00:03:06] things under control. And why now? I can
[00:03:09] say that it can't come soon enough.
[00:03:11] Frankly, we want to keep bad people out
[00:03:14] of our country. Uh the Biden
[00:03:16] administration allowed some horrendous
[00:03:19] people and we're getting them out one by
[00:03:21] one and we're not stopping until we get
[00:03:23] them out. We have thousands of
[00:03:25] murderers. I hate to I even hate to say
[00:03:28] this in front of the chancellor. Of
[00:03:30] course, you have a little problem too
[00:03:31] with some of the people that were
[00:03:32] allowed into this country. It's not your
[00:03:34] fault. It's not your fault. It shouldn't
[00:03:36] have happened. I told her it shouldn't
[00:03:37] have happened what she did, but you have
[00:03:40] uh you have your own difficulty with
[00:03:41] that. And we do. And we're moving them
[00:03:43] out. and we're moving them out very
[00:03:45] strongly. Uh, but it can't come fast
[00:03:48] enough. We want to get them out. We want
[00:03:49] to get them out now. We don't want to
[00:03:50] have other bad people coming into our
[00:03:52] country. By using the word bad, I'm
[00:03:55] being nice. Okay. Question is a
[00:03:57] distraction. You put out on truth social
[00:04:00] a post regarding your conversation with
[00:04:02] President Xi. Uh, can you talk about
[00:04:05] whether or not you feel that trade
[00:04:07] talks, trade relations are back on track
[00:04:10] after appearing to be a little bit off
[00:04:12] track last week? a little bit off track.
[00:04:14] It was only the complexity. It was It's
[00:04:16] pretty complex stuff. We had a very good
[00:04:19] conversation with President Xi a little
[00:04:21] while ago just before Yeah. your
[00:04:23] arrival. In fact, we just hung up and
[00:04:25] they said, "You're here." I said,
[00:04:26] "That's pretty good. Two two great
[00:04:29] leaders of the world in a very short
[00:04:31] period of time. Uh we had a very good
[00:04:34] talk and uh we've straightened out any
[00:04:37] complexity and it's it's very complex
[00:04:39] stuff and we straighten it out. Uh the
[00:04:43] agreement was we're going to have Scott
[00:04:46] and uh Howard and Jameson will be going
[00:04:50] and meeting with their top people and
[00:04:53] continue it forward. But no, I think we
[00:04:54] have everything. I think we're in very
[00:04:56] good shape with China and the trade
[00:04:58] deal. Uh we have a deal with China as
[00:05:01] you know, but we were straightening out
[00:05:03] some of the points having to do mostly
[00:05:06] with rare earth uh magnets and some
[00:05:09] other things. So, those reduced trade
[00:05:11] tariff rates, they remain in effect.
[00:05:13] Yeah, we have we have the deal. I mean,
[00:05:15] we've had a deal. We announced the deal
[00:05:18] and uh we'll be uh I guess you could say
[00:05:20] I wouldn't even say finalizing it up,
[00:05:22] Scott. I would say we have a deal and
[00:05:24] we're going to just make sure that
[00:05:25] everybody understands what the deal is.
[00:05:27] Okay.
[00:05:29] We had a really good conversation. By
[00:05:31] the way, he invited me to China and I
[00:05:32] invited him here. We both accepted. So
[00:05:35] I'll be going there with the first lady
[00:05:37] at a certain point and uh he'll be
[00:05:40] coming here hopefully with the first
[00:05:41] lady of
[00:05:44] China from Germany. Did you talk about
[00:05:47] uh the Chinese students? Are you
[00:05:50] allowing them to come to to the US? No,
[00:05:53] Chinese students are coming. No problem.
[00:05:56] No problem. Okay. It's our honor to have
[00:05:59] them. Frankly, look, we want to have we
[00:06:01] want to have foreign students, but we
[00:06:03] want them to be checked. you know, in
[00:06:04] the case of Harvard and Colombia and
[00:06:06] others, uh, all we want to do is see
[00:06:09] their list. There's no problem with
[00:06:11] that. This is anybody outside of our
[00:06:13] country, international students, because
[00:06:16] when we see some of the people that
[00:06:18] we've been watching, we say, "Where do
[00:06:20] these people come from? How is that
[00:06:22] possible?" No, we want to have foreign
[00:06:24] students come. We're very honored by it,
[00:06:26] but we want to see their list. Harvard
[00:06:27] didn't want to give us the list. They're
[00:06:29] going to be giving us the list now.
[00:06:31] I think they're starting to behave.
[00:06:33] Actually, if you want to know the truth,
[00:06:35] [Music]
[00:06:37] on Russia, are you are you willing to
[00:06:39] put more pressure on Putin to end the
[00:06:41] war by imposing new sanctions on Russia
[00:06:44] and also on China? Well, remember I'm
[00:06:46] the one that ended Nordstream, too.
[00:06:49] Going to a place called Germany, come to
[00:06:50] think of I'm sorry I did that. I don't
[00:06:52] know, but uh I ended Nordstream, too.
[00:06:55] Nobody else did. And then when Biden
[00:06:57] came in, he immediately approved it.
[00:06:58] That's the largest essentially the
[00:07:00] largest pipeline in the world going to
[00:07:02] Germany and other countries. Uh and by
[00:07:05] the way, we have so much oil and gas you
[00:07:07] you will not be able to buy it all. I
[00:07:10] mean you you literally we have so much
[00:07:12] and I hope we're going to make that a
[00:07:14] part of our trade deal because we have
[00:07:16] more than anybody else. We have actually
[00:07:18] the most by far in the world probably
[00:07:20] double what anyone else has. So we'll
[00:07:22] work on that. I'm sure that's something
[00:07:24] we'll discuss today. Mr. President, Mr.
[00:07:26] President, what do you expect from
[00:07:28] Germany and what do you expect from the
[00:07:30] chancellor? Well, first of all, I'm glad
[00:07:33] to meet because I've been dealing with
[00:07:34] the chancellor and he's very uh uh a
[00:07:38] very good man to deal with. He's
[00:07:39] difficult, I would say. Can I say that?
[00:07:41] It's a positive. Go ahead. You wouldn't
[00:07:42] want me to say you're easy, right? No,
[00:07:45] he's he's a very great representative of
[00:07:47] Germany. I think all we uh want is just
[00:07:50] going to have a good relationship. The
[00:07:52] rest will just sort of follow very
[00:07:54] easily. We'll have a a good trade deal.
[00:07:56] I mean, I guess that will be mostly
[00:07:58] determined by the European Union, but
[00:08:00] you're a very big part of that, so
[00:08:02] you'll be involved, but uh we'll end up
[00:08:05] hopefully with a trade deal or or we'll
[00:08:07] do something, you know, we'll do the
[00:08:08] tariffs. I mean, I'm okay with the
[00:08:10] tariffs or we make a deal with the trade
[00:08:12] and I guess that's what we're discussing
[00:08:14] now. Mr. President,
[00:08:17] back up, please. Mr. President, okay, is
[00:08:21] is Germany doing enough on defense, Mr.
[00:08:24] President? Is Germany doing enough on
[00:08:26] defense? What defense spending? Is
[00:08:28] Germany doing enough on defense? The
[00:08:29] chancellor The Chancellor wants Is
[00:08:31] Germany doing enough on wants to spend
[00:08:33] 3.5? Well, I don't know. I mean, I
[00:08:35] haven't discussed it very much. I know
[00:08:37] that you're spending more money on
[00:08:38] defense now and uh quite a bit more
[00:08:42] money and that's a positive definitely
[00:08:44] thing. I'm not sure that General
[00:08:46] MacArthur would have said it's positive.
[00:08:48] You know, he wouldn't like it, but I
[00:08:50] sort of think it's good. You understand
[00:08:52] what I mean by that? Well, I understand.
[00:08:54] He made a statement, never let Germany
[00:08:57] rearm. And I said, I always think about
[00:09:00] that when he says, "Sir, we're spending
[00:09:01] more money on defense." I say, "Oh, is
[00:09:03] that a good thing or a bad thing?" I
[00:09:05] think it's a good thing. Uh, but you
[00:09:08] know, at least a certain point. There'll
[00:09:10] be a point when I'll say, "Please don't
[00:09:11] arm anymore if you don't mind." We'll be
[00:09:14] watching him. I'll get it. Mr.
[00:09:16] President, Mr. President, Biden. Mr.
[00:09:19] President. Yeah. Biden, you said
[00:09:22] uh your your predecessor dismissed uh
[00:09:24] your autopen investigation. He said he
[00:09:26] made all the decisions during his
[00:09:27] presidency. I'm curious your reaction to
[00:09:29] his dismissal. Well, look, the autopen I
[00:09:32] think is the big scandal outside of the
[00:09:34] rigged election of 2020. I think the
[00:09:36] biggest scandal of the last many years
[00:09:38] is the auto pen. And who's using it? I
[00:09:41] happen to think I know, okay, because
[00:09:43] I'm here and I'm not a big autopen
[00:09:45] person, fortunately. I'm glad. I'm very
[00:09:47] glad. It's an easy way out.
[00:09:49] But it's uh it's a very bad thing, very
[00:09:52] dangerous. You know, I sign important
[00:09:54] documents. Usually when they put
[00:09:55] documents in front of you, they're
[00:09:57] important. Uh even if you're signing
[00:09:59] ambassadorships or and I consider that
[00:10:02] important. I think it's inappropriate.
[00:10:03] You have somebody that's devoting four
[00:10:04] years of their life or more to being an
[00:10:07] ambassador. I think you really deserve
[00:10:09] that person deserves to get a real
[00:10:10] signature, not an autopens signature.
[00:10:13] And I can tell autopen easily. I can
[00:10:15] look at it uh like two little pin holes
[00:10:19] from pulling the paper, right? You
[00:10:20] always see the pin holes. It's real easy
[00:10:23] to tell about autopen. I think it's very
[00:10:25] disrespectful to people when they get an
[00:10:28] autopen signature outside. Autopen to me
[00:10:31] are used when thousands of letters come
[00:10:33] in from young people all over the
[00:10:34] country and you want to get them back.
[00:10:36] And you know, people use autopens for
[00:10:38] that to send a a little signature at the
[00:10:41] bottom of a letter. We have thousands of
[00:10:44] them. We get thousands of of letters a
[00:10:47] week and it's not possible to, you know,
[00:10:49] do I'd like to do it myself, but you
[00:10:51] can't do it. To me, that's where auto
[00:10:54] pens start and stop, but I don't think I
[00:10:58] don't I I'm sure that he didn't know
[00:10:59] many of the things. Look, he was never
[00:11:01] for open borders. He was never for
[00:11:03] transgender for everybody. He was never
[00:11:05] for men playing in women's sports. I
[00:11:08] mean, he changed. I mean, all of these
[00:11:10] things that that changed so radically. I
[00:11:12] don't think he had any idea that what
[00:11:15] was frankly I said it during the debate
[00:11:17] and I say it now uh he didn't have much
[00:11:19] of an idea what was going on. Mr.
[00:11:21] President, you shouldn't be I mean
[00:11:23] essentially whoever used the autopan was
[00:11:25] the president and that is uh wrong. It's
[00:11:29] illegal. It's so bad and it's so
[00:11:31] disrespectful to our country. Mr.
[00:11:34] President, Mr. President, will you leave
[00:11:36] the your troops in Germany? And if I may
[00:11:39] ask a question to the chancellor to
[00:11:41] answer in German for the German
[00:11:43] audience. How is your first encounter
[00:11:46] in?
[00:11:48] Uh the answer is yes. We'll talk about
[00:11:50] that. But if they'd like to have them
[00:11:52] there, you know, we've have a we have a
[00:11:54] lot of them, about 45,000. It's a lot of
[00:11:57] troops. It's a city when you think about
[00:12:00] that's good economic development.
[00:12:01] They're highly paid troops and they
[00:12:03] spend a lot of money in Germany, but the
[00:12:05] relationship with Germany is very
[00:12:07] important. Yeah, we'll we'll be doing
[00:12:08] that. No problem. May I say a few words
[00:12:10] in German to the Germans
[00:12:18] public
[00:12:27] office. Mr. President, you've made Mr.
[00:12:29] President, you speak uh English because
[00:12:32] you speak such good English. Is it as
[00:12:34] good as your German, would you say? No.
[00:12:36] Do you feel more comfortable tongue? No,
[00:12:38] it's not my mother tongue, but I try to
[00:12:40] to understand almost everything and to
[00:12:42] to speak as good as I can. Very good.
[00:12:44] You know, it's Mr. President, you've
[00:12:46] made It's an achievement actually. Thank
[00:12:47] you, Mr. President. Mr. President, can
[00:12:49] we follow that regard? Thank you, Mr.
[00:12:51] President. The criticism that I've seen
[00:12:53] and I'm sure you've seen regarding Elon
[00:12:55] Musk and your big beautiful bill. What's
[00:12:57] your reaction to that? Do you think it
[00:12:59] in any way hurts passage in the Senate,
[00:13:01] which of course what is your seeking?
[00:13:03] Well, look, you know, I've always liked
[00:13:05] Elon and it's always very surprised. You
[00:13:07] saw the words he had for me. The words
[00:13:09] are for and he hasn't said anything
[00:13:11] about me that's bad. I'd rather have him
[00:13:13] criticize me than the bill because the
[00:13:15] bill is incredible. It's the biggest cut
[00:13:18] in the history of our country. We've
[00:13:20] never cut. Uh it's about 1.6 trillion in
[00:13:23] cuts. It's the biggest tax cut tax you
[00:13:27] would say uh people people's taxes will
[00:13:30] go way down, but it's the biggest tax
[00:13:32] cut in history. It's uh we have we are
[00:13:35] doing things in that bill that are
[00:13:37] unbelievable. And uh when you look at
[00:13:39] what we're doing for small businesses,
[00:13:41] for people, for middle inome people, all
[00:13:44] of the things that we're doing, nobody's
[00:13:47] ever seen anything like it. And you
[00:13:49] know, Elon's upset because we took the
[00:13:52] EV mandate and you know, which was a lot
[00:13:54] of money for electric vehicles and uh
[00:13:57] you know, they're having a hard time the
[00:13:59] electric vehicles and they want us to
[00:14:00] pay billions of dollars in subsidy. And
[00:14:05] you know, I I Elon knew this from the
[00:14:08] beginning. He knew it for a long time
[00:14:09] ago. That's been in there. That's been
[00:14:11] uh I would say JD that hasn't changed.
[00:14:14] That's been right from the beginning.
[00:14:15] Mr. I think Mr. Secretary, that hasn't
[00:14:17] changed at all. right from the
[00:14:19] beginning. But I know that it disturbed
[00:14:21] him. Uh he wanted and rightfully, you
[00:14:24] know, he recommended somebody from uh
[00:14:26] that he I guess knew very well. I'm sure
[00:14:29] he respected him, but to run NASA and I
[00:14:33] didn't think it was appropriate. And he
[00:14:35] happened to be a Democrat, like totally
[00:14:38] Democrat. And I say, you know, look, we
[00:14:40] won. We get certain privileges and one
[00:14:43] of the privileges we don't have to
[00:14:44] appoint a Democrat. NASA is very
[00:14:46] important. We have great people. General
[00:14:49] Kaine is going to be picking somebody
[00:14:52] with our uh we'll be we'll be checking
[00:14:55] them out and seeing but uh he wanted
[00:14:57] that person a certain person and we said
[00:14:59] no. And you I can understand why he's
[00:15:02] upset. Remember he was here for a long
[00:15:04] time. You saw a man who was very happy
[00:15:08] when he stood behind the oval desk and
[00:15:11] uh even with the black eye. I said, "Do
[00:15:13] you want a little makeup? We'll get you
[00:15:14] a little makeup." But he said, "No, I
[00:15:17] don't think so." Which is
[00:15:19] interesting and very nice. He wants to
[00:15:21] be who he is. So, you could make that
[00:15:23] statement, too. I guess. Look, Elon and
[00:15:26] I had a great
[00:15:28] relationship. Uh, I don't know if we
[00:15:30] will anymore. I was surprised because
[00:15:31] you were here. Everybody in this room
[00:15:33] practically was here as we had a
[00:15:35] wonderful sendoff. He said wonderful
[00:15:37] things about me. You couldn't have
[00:15:38] nicer. Said the best thing. He's worn
[00:15:41] the hat. Trump was right about
[00:15:43] everything. And I am right about the
[00:15:46] great big beautiful bill. We call it a
[00:15:48] great big beautiful bill because that's
[00:15:50] what it is. And uh again, biggest tax
[00:15:53] cuts in history, biggest economic
[00:15:55] development moves anywhere. We've never
[00:15:57] done anything like it. Uh business is
[00:16:00] spurred. And I don't know if you've seen
[00:16:02] the numbers, but the numbers came out.
[00:16:04] Even the CBO, which is run by Democrats,
[00:16:07] said that we're going to be uh doing,
[00:16:09] you know, I'd like you to discuss it.
[00:16:10] The 2.8 8 billion a trillion that CBO
[00:16:14] this is some a group of people that are
[00:16:17] Democrats they're very hostile to us
[00:16:20] they just came out with phenomenal
[00:16:22] numbers what it does you want to mention
[00:16:23] that's yes sir so what what we've seen
[00:16:26] is we keep hearing from the CBO that
[00:16:28] there's going to be a large deficit from
[00:16:31] the bill which we disagree with but
[00:16:32] using the CBO scoring uh they came out
[00:16:36] and scored the tariff revenue we think
[00:16:38] it'll be the minimum of 2.8 8 trillion
[00:16:40] over the 10-year window, which actually
[00:16:43] puts the bill in surplus if you include
[00:16:45] the tariff revenue, which they won't do.
[00:16:48] It gives you a tremendous surplus, but
[00:16:50] we're not allowed to use that for some
[00:16:52] reason. They say scoring. Nobody knows
[00:16:54] what scoring means. Maybe a couple of
[00:16:56] people, but nobody. Somebody sits in the
[00:16:59] background, they say, "Well, we're not
[00:17:00] going to allow that." They're not
[00:17:01] allowing other things that we have that
[00:17:03] are tremendously profitable for our
[00:17:05] country. But if you saw the other day
[00:17:07] CNBC, they came out with uh numbers and
[00:17:11] the people on the show, very good
[00:17:12] people. I've watched them for a long
[00:17:14] time. They couldn't believe the numbers
[00:17:16] how good they are. The numbers were
[00:17:18] incredible. And that was personal income
[00:17:19] and also very low inflation. We have
[00:17:22] very low inflation. We're down to 2% now
[00:17:25] and maybe even lower than that. And when
[00:17:27] I took it over, it was a mess. Remember,
[00:17:30] we had the worst inflation probably in
[00:17:32] the history of our country. They say 48
[00:17:34] years, but let's say that's I think it's
[00:17:37] worse than that. So, we had the worst
[00:17:39] inflation in the history of our country
[00:17:41] under the Biden administration. Now,
[00:17:44] we're down to a beautiful number, 2%.
[00:17:47] You'd actually like to keep it there.
[00:17:49] Better than zero is 2%. It's going down
[00:17:51] maybe to one. And 1% is like perfect.
[00:17:54] That's perfect. You don't want to have
[00:17:56] zero for certain reasons that are that
[00:17:59] nobody is very interested to listen to.
[00:18:02] But we have almost perfect inflation.
[00:18:04] Grocery prices are down. Everything.
[00:18:07] Remember eggs? Eggs. We weren't going to
[00:18:09] buy another egg for the next 20 years.
[00:18:11] They were so expensive, right? Remember,
[00:18:13] you guys all hit me about eggs. Eggs
[00:18:15] have come down 400%. Everybody has eggs
[00:18:18] now. They're having eggs for breakfast
[00:18:20] again. But if you look at gasoline, very
[00:18:22] important, I think always the most
[00:18:24] important because it's the energy is a
[00:18:26] big the biggest factor. That's what
[00:18:28] happened. he screwed up our energy
[00:18:29] policy and everything went up because
[00:18:32] energy went up. But now energy is way
[00:18:34] down and uh they have states where you
[00:18:37] at
[00:18:37] $1.98 cents a gallon for gasoline. So
[00:18:41] the costs have way have come way down
[00:18:44] and one of the things I ran on was that
[00:18:47] I ran on the border. We have the best
[00:18:49] border in the history of our country
[00:18:50] 99.99%.
[00:18:53] It was uh last week three people came
[00:18:56] in. Two of them for medical reasons. We
[00:18:58] let them in because one of them had a
[00:19:00] heart attack. I think it was a nice
[00:19:02] thing to do and one of them had
[00:19:03] something else. So we've never had I had
[00:19:07] very good numbers for four years, but we
[00:19:10] we really topped it. And I want to thank
[00:19:12] Christie and Tom Holman. They've done a
[00:19:14] fantastic job. But nobody mentions that
[00:19:17] anymore. Remember a few months ago the
[00:19:20] border was a total disaster. People were
[00:19:22] coming in by the hundreds of thousands
[00:19:25] of people a day, a week, a month. I
[00:19:28] mean, we had a month, two million people
[00:19:30] came in in one month. The border was
[00:19:33] being overrun and a lot of bad people,
[00:19:36] criminals, murderers, drug dealers. We
[00:19:38] had some of the worst people in the
[00:19:40] world coming in from all over the world.
[00:19:42] It's totally closed. And you know what?
[00:19:44] People are coming into our country, but
[00:19:46] they're coming in legally. So, we've
[00:19:48] done a great job. Elon knew that. Elon
[00:19:51] endorsed me very strongly. He actually
[00:19:53] went up in campaign for me. I think I
[00:19:56] would have won, Susie would say, I would
[00:19:57] have won Pennsylvania easily anyway,
[00:19:59] even if the governor ran, the real
[00:20:02] governor, not the governor from
[00:20:03] Minnesota who's I mean, he's a sick
[00:20:05] puppy. That guy, that poor guy feels
[00:20:06] sorry for him. But, uh, they they made a
[00:20:09] bad choice with him. But if you pick
[00:20:12] Shapiro or anybody else, I spoke to him
[00:20:14] recently about his, you know, his, uh,
[00:20:17] house being set on fire, which was
[00:20:19] terrible. But if they picked him, I
[00:20:21] would have won Pennsylvania. I won it by
[00:20:23] a lot. Uh, but I'm very disappointed
[00:20:26] because Elon knew the inner workings of
[00:20:28] this bill better than almost anybody
[00:20:31] sitting here. Better than you people. He
[00:20:33] knew everything about it. He had no
[00:20:34] problem with it. All of a sudden, he had
[00:20:36] a problem. And he only developed the
[00:20:38] problem when he found out that we're
[00:20:39] going to have to cut the EV mandate
[00:20:41] because that's billions and billions of
[00:20:42] dollars. And it really is unfair. We
[00:20:45] want to have cars of all types.
[00:20:47] Electric. We want to have electric, but
[00:20:48] we want to have gasoline,
[00:20:51] uh, combustion, we want to have
[00:20:53] different, we want to have hybrids, we
[00:20:55] want to have all, we want to be able to
[00:20:56] sell everything. And when that was cut
[00:21:00] and Congress wanted to cut it, uh, he
[00:21:03] became a little bit different and I can
[00:21:04] understand that. But he knew every
[00:21:07] aspect of this bill. He knew it better
[00:21:09] than almost anybody and he never had a
[00:21:11] problem until right after he left. And
[00:21:14] if you saw the statements he made about
[00:21:15] me, which I'm sure you can get very
[00:21:17] easily. It's very fresh on tape, uh, he
[00:21:20] said the most beautiful things about me.
[00:21:22] And he hasn't said bad about me
[00:21:23] personally, but I'm sure that'll be
[00:21:24] next. But I'm I'm very disappointed in
[00:21:27] Elon. I've helped Elon a lot. Mr.
[00:21:30] President, did he I just want to
[00:21:31] clarify. Did he raise any of these
[00:21:33] concerns with you privately before he
[00:21:35] raised them publicly? And this is the
[00:21:36] guy you put in charge of cutting
[00:21:38] spending. Should people not take him
[00:21:40] seriously about spending now? Are you
[00:21:41] saying this is all sour grapes? you
[00:21:42] know, he worked hard and he did a good
[00:21:44] job. And I'll be honest, I think he
[00:21:46] misses the place. I think he got out
[00:21:49] there and all of a sudden he wasn't in
[00:21:50] this beautiful Oval Office and he was
[00:21:52] and he's got nice offices, too. But
[00:21:54] there's something about this one. I was
[00:21:56] telling the chancellor, this is where it
[00:21:58] is. People come in here, even from
[00:22:00] Germany. They come in and they they walk
[00:22:03] into the Oval Office and it's just a
[00:22:05] special place. It's, you know, World War
[00:22:07] I, it started and it ended here. and
[00:22:10] World War II and uh so many other
[00:22:12] things. Everything big comes right from
[00:22:15] this this beautiful space. It's now much
[00:22:17] more beautiful than it was six months
[00:22:19] ago. Uh a lot of good things are
[00:22:22] happening in this room. And I'll I'll
[00:22:24] tell you it's not he's not the first.
[00:22:26] people leave my
[00:22:30] administration and they love us and then
[00:22:34] at some point they miss it so badly and
[00:22:36] some of them embrace it and some of them
[00:22:39] actually become hostile. I don't know
[00:22:41] what it is. It's sort of Trump
[00:22:42] derangement syndrome I guess they call
[00:22:44] it but I we have it with others too.
[00:22:46] They leave and they wake up in the
[00:22:49] morning and the glamour's gone. The
[00:22:52] whole world is different and they become
[00:22:54] hostile. I don't know what it is.
[00:22:56] Someday you'll write a book about it and
[00:22:57] you'll let us know. Yeah. Mr. President,
[00:22:59] speaking of ending wars in this room,
[00:23:02] you were very critical of Vladimir Putin
[00:23:04] a couple of days ago. What kind of play
[00:23:07] is he playing from your perspective?
[00:23:08] What are Well, look, he's he he got hit.
[00:23:11] He's been doing hitting, so I understand
[00:23:14] it. But he got hit hard. And I don't
[00:23:18] think he's playing games. I think he
[00:23:20] I've always said he wanted the whole
[00:23:21] thing. I thought he wanted the entire uh
[00:23:25] everything having to do with Ukraine.
[00:23:28] That's something that would have never
[00:23:29] happened if I were president. The
[00:23:31] election was rigged. I didn't get to be
[00:23:32] president, but I got to be president
[00:23:34] now. And I think it's a much more
[00:23:36] important presidency other than a couple
[00:23:38] of things like that. The war would have
[00:23:41] never would have never happened. The war
[00:23:44] with Ukraine, with Putin would have
[00:23:45] never happened ever. Not even a chance.
[00:23:47] And it didn't happen for four years. And
[00:23:49] it wasn't thought of. I used to talk to
[00:23:51] him about Ukraine a lot. It was the
[00:23:53] apple of his eye, but he would have
[00:23:54] never done what he did. Uh, and I think
[00:23:58] mistakes were made by him, but I think
[00:23:59] mistakes were made by uh other people.
[00:24:03] The president should have never allowed
[00:24:04] that war. Biden should have never
[00:24:06] allowed that war to happen. If you had
[00:24:09] the right guy in here, that war would
[00:24:11] have never happened. Israel would have
[00:24:12] never happened with
[00:24:14] Hamas. Uh, that would have never
[00:24:16] happened. The attack on Israel would
[00:24:18] have never happened because Iran was
[00:24:21] broke. They had no money. They had no
[00:24:23] money to give to Hamas or Hezbollah or
[00:24:26] anybody else. And all of that would have
[00:24:28] never happened. Inflation wouldn't have
[00:24:30] happened. It was caused mostly by
[00:24:32] energy. And the Biden administration
[00:24:34] messed up my great energy policy. We
[00:24:37] were down into the 190 a gallon and it
[00:24:41] would have never happened. It was caused
[00:24:42] by energy and their bad spending on the
[00:24:44] Green New scam and other things that
[00:24:46] they spent on. But all of those things
[00:24:48] would have never happened. But maybe
[00:24:50] most importantly, uh the war chancellor
[00:24:53] with with uh Russia would never have
[00:24:57] happened with Ukraine. Uh it it was
[00:25:00] something that would have you know I I
[00:25:02] dealt with Putin a lot. There was no
[00:25:04] chance. Zero. And you know a lot of
[00:25:07] people say how do you know for four
[00:25:08] years it didn't happen. There was never
[00:25:10] a chance of it happening. and he
[00:25:12] understood the consequences. Now, uh
[00:25:15] it's a shame. I mean, when you see all
[00:25:17] of those people, they came out with a
[00:25:19] report today that uh that millions of
[00:25:23] people millions of people have died.
[00:25:25] Much more than people thought, and I've
[00:25:28] been saying that for a long time. The
[00:25:30] amount of death in that war is far
[00:25:32] greater than the news has been reporting
[00:25:34] or than frankly that either side has
[00:25:37] been reporting. It's a very sad thing.
[00:25:38] And I can tell you just speaking for the
[00:25:40] chancellor because we speak about it uh
[00:25:42] he feels the same way. He wants to see
[00:25:44] it ended. Would you like Absolutely. And
[00:25:47] I'm here, Mr. President, to talk with
[00:25:49] you later on on how we could uh
[00:25:52] contribute to to that goal. And we all
[00:25:55] are looking for uh measures and for
[00:25:59] instruments to bring this terrible war
[00:26:02] to an end. And may I remind you that we
[00:26:05] are having June 6 tomorrow. This is
[00:26:08] D-Day anniversary when the Americans
[00:26:11] once ended a war in Europe and I think
[00:26:16] this is in your hand in specific in
[00:26:18] ours. That was not a pleasant day for
[00:26:20] you. No, that was not not a pleasant
[00:26:22] well in the long run, Mr. President.
[00:26:25] This was the liberation of my country
[00:26:27] from Nazi Nazi dictatorship. That's
[00:26:29] true. That's true. And we we know what
[00:26:31] we owe you. But uh this is the reason
[00:26:33] why I'm I'm saying that America is again
[00:26:36] in a very strong position to do
[00:26:38] something on this war and ending this
[00:26:41] war. So let's talk about what we can do
[00:26:44] jointly and we are ready to do what we
[00:26:46] can and you know that we gave support to
[00:26:48] Ukraine and that we are looking for more
[00:26:51] pressure on Russia. The European Union
[00:26:53] did and we should talk about that. We
[00:26:55] will talk about it and you know it's
[00:26:57] good timing. The numbers for our country
[00:26:59] are through the roof. uh the economic
[00:27:02] numbers because of the election and
[00:27:04] because of tariffs and other things, a
[00:27:06] lot of things, but uh we've had some of
[00:27:08] the best numbers we've ever had. They
[00:27:11] were reported yesterday, the day before,
[00:27:12] and even today, country is doing really
[00:27:15] well. Uh I think that one of the things
[00:27:18] you'll be most interested in is that 6
[00:27:21] months ago, we were having a hard time
[00:27:22] getting anybody to join our military. I
[00:27:25] mean, they just couldn't do it. The
[00:27:26] numbers were record low. We couldn't get
[00:27:29] people to join the military. It wasn't
[00:27:30] me. This is before I got there. The past
[00:27:33] administration, but six months ago, a
[00:27:35] year ago, uh the numbers were record
[00:27:38] low. You couldn't get them to join. That
[00:27:40] included the police. And you couldn't
[00:27:43] get them to join. Now we just hit the
[00:27:46] highest number in the history of our
[00:27:49] country we think but very close but the
[00:27:51] highest in the history of our country
[00:27:53] recruitment joining the army navy air
[00:27:56] force marines coast guard police forces
[00:28:00] all over the country what did you do for
[00:28:01] that what what was the reason spirit
[00:28:02] they love our country again you know
[00:28:04] you're going to do the same thing spirit
[00:28:07] we have we have great spirit is back in
[00:28:11] our country and it's very simple you
[00:28:12] know it was only Susie six months months
[00:28:14] ago, right, that you got reports, you're
[00:28:16] the one that released them, that you
[00:28:18] couldn't get anybody to join the
[00:28:19] military, and now we're we're stocked.
[00:28:22] Every service now is is packed, and we
[00:28:25] have waiting lists of people trying to
[00:28:27] get in, as good as we've ever had in the
[00:28:29] history of our country. So, that's an
[00:28:31] honor. That's a great honor, Mr.
[00:28:33] President, on the war. You've you've
[00:28:35] asked, you've had enough. Go ahead, Mr.
[00:28:38] President. Um, so would you consider to
[00:28:40] put more sanctions on Russia because
[00:28:42] this discussion is going on now for
[00:28:44] weeks and months and you tweeted about
[00:28:46] it once but then nothing happened. So
[00:28:48] yeah, when I see when I see the moment
[00:28:50] when we're not going to make a deal,
[00:28:51] when this thing won't stop, uh, is there
[00:28:54] a deadline if that moment Yeah, it's in
[00:28:56] my my brain the deadline. when I when I
[00:28:59] see the moment where uh it's not going
[00:29:03] to stop and I'm sure you're going to do
[00:29:04] the same thing we'll be very very very
[00:29:07] tough and it could be on both countries
[00:29:10] to be honest you know it takes two to
[00:29:11] tango but they'll be we're going to be
[00:29:13] very tough whether it's Russia or
[00:29:16] anybody else we're going to be very
[00:29:17] tough that that's a bloodbath that's
[00:29:19] going on over there and when I see the
[00:29:23] moment where I say well they're going to
[00:29:25] just keep fighting you know I gave the
[00:29:27] analogy yesterday when I spoke spoke to
[00:29:29] President Putin. I had a 2 hour and 15
[00:29:31] minute call with him. Sometimes, and
[00:29:35] this is me speaking maybe in a negative
[00:29:37] sense, but sometimes you see two young
[00:29:40] children fighting like crazy. They hate
[00:29:43] each other and they're fighting in a
[00:29:45] park and you try and pull them apart.
[00:29:48] They don't want to be pulled. Sometimes
[00:29:49] you're better off letting them fight for
[00:29:50] a while and then pulling them apart. And
[00:29:55] I gave that analogy to Putin yesterday.
[00:29:58] I said, uh,
[00:29:59] President, maybe you're going to have to
[00:30:01] keep fighting and suffering a lot
[00:30:03] because both sides are suffering before
[00:30:06] you pull them apart, before they're able
[00:30:08] to be pulled apart. But it's a pretty
[00:30:09] known uh analogy. You you have two kids,
[00:30:12] they fight, fight, fight. Sometimes you
[00:30:15] let them fight for a little while. You
[00:30:16] see it in hockey, you see it in sports.
[00:30:19] the referees. Let him go for a couple of
[00:30:21] seconds. Let him go for a little while
[00:30:24] before you pull them apart. And maybe
[00:30:26] maybe and I said it and maybe that's a
[00:30:29] negative because we're saying go, but
[00:30:32] uh a lot of bad blood. There's some bad
[00:30:35] blood between the two. I have to deal
[00:30:37] with it and the chancellor has to deal
[00:30:39] with it. It's incredible the level of
[00:30:40] there's a great hatred between those two
[00:30:43] between those two men uh but between the
[00:30:47] waring parties. Great hatred. What can
[00:30:49] you say and believe apparently that
[00:30:51] there's no immediate peace? What? That
[00:30:53] there is no immediate peace. There will
[00:30:55] be no Well, I can't I'd love to have
[00:30:56] immediate if I could. If I could, but we
[00:30:59] don't we don't have immediate. You know,
[00:31:01] it's like uh I'd love to have that. Uh
[00:31:04] I'd like it to start right now. We would
[00:31:06] leave a room if we knew the work. Then
[00:31:08] we'd we'd say, "Forget about you guys.
[00:31:10] Forget forget about trade, right? We'd
[00:31:12] say let's go settle it." uh there's some
[00:31:16] additional fighting that's going to go
[00:31:18] on. You know, he was he attacked and
[00:31:21] they attacked pretty harshly. They went
[00:31:25] deep into
[00:31:26] Russia. And he actually told me, I mean,
[00:31:28] I I made it very clear. He said, "We
[00:31:32] have no choice but to attack based on
[00:31:34] that, and it's probably not going to be
[00:31:37] pretty. I don't like it." I said, "Don't
[00:31:39] do it. You shouldn't do it. You should
[00:31:41] stop it." But uh again there's a lot of
[00:31:44] hatred and you know I'm very proud of
[00:31:47] the fact that with India and Pakistan I
[00:31:51] was able to stop that and those are
[00:31:53] nuclear powers and that would have
[00:31:54] really that was getting close to being
[00:31:56] out of hand and I spoke to some very
[00:31:59] talented people on both sides very good
[00:32:01] people on both sides and I said you know
[00:32:04] we're dealing with you on trade Pakistan
[00:32:06] and India right now I said we're not
[00:32:08] going to deal with you on trade if
[00:32:10] you're going to go shooting each other
[00:32:11] and whipping ripping out nuclear weapons
[00:32:14] that maybe even affect us because you
[00:32:16] know that nuclear dust blows across
[00:32:18] oceans very quickly. It affects us and I
[00:32:21] said if you're going to do that we're
[00:32:23] not going to do any trade deals and you
[00:32:24] know what I got that war stopped. Now I
[00:32:27] hope we don't go back and we find out
[00:32:29] that they started but I don't think they
[00:32:30] will. They were both good. They were
[00:32:32] well represented. I want to congratulate
[00:32:35] both countries uh because as you know uh
[00:32:40] the leader of India who's a great guy
[00:32:42] was here a few weeks ago. We had some
[00:32:44] great talks with doing a trade deal and
[00:32:47] Pakistan likewise they have very very
[00:32:51] strong leadership. Some people won't
[00:32:52] like when I say that but you know it is
[00:32:54] what it is and they stopped that war.
[00:32:57] Now am I going to get credit? I'll never
[00:32:59] get credit for anything. They don't give
[00:33:01] me credit for anything, but nobody else
[00:33:03] could have done it. I stopped it. I was
[00:33:05] very proud of that. Uh I wish we could
[00:33:08] do the same thing with Ukraine and
[00:33:11] Russia. And at some point it'll happen.
[00:33:14] I believe that. Uh and if it doesn't
[00:33:16] happen or if I see somebody's out of
[00:33:18] line, if Russia's out of line, uh we'll
[00:33:20] be uh you'll be amazed how tough.
[00:33:24] Remember this. They like to say that I'm
[00:33:28] friends with I'm not friends with
[00:33:29] anybody. I'm friends with you. I'm not
[00:33:32] friends with I want the right thing to
[00:33:34] happen for our country, for everybody,
[00:33:36] for humanity. But I'm the one that
[00:33:38] stopped the pipeline. It's called
[00:33:39] Nordstream 2. Until I came along, nobody
[00:33:42] ever heard, not one person in this room
[00:33:44] ever heard of Nordstream 2. You probably
[00:33:46] did because it went to Germany. He's the
[00:33:48] only one knowing that this was a
[00:33:49] mistake. But I stopped him. I stopped
[00:33:52] it. Yeah. And you've said that openly.
[00:33:54] It was a mistake because and I used to
[00:33:56] go with Angala. I'd say, "Well, wait a
[00:33:57] minute. We're spending all this money to
[00:33:59] defend you against Russia and then
[00:34:02] you're giving Russia billions of dollars
[00:34:04] a month. What kind of a deal is that?"
[00:34:06] You know, which was uh but you said it
[00:34:08] better than anybody else. I appreciate
[00:34:10] it. But I I'm the one that stopped it.
[00:34:13] And that was the biggest economic
[00:34:14] development job, if you want to call it
[00:34:16] that, in the history, think of it, in
[00:34:18] the history of Russia. That was a
[00:34:20] massive It's the biggest pipeline in the
[00:34:22] world. gonna go all over Europe. Not
[00:34:24] only to Germany, you know, the Germany,
[00:34:26] but then they were branching off all
[00:34:27] over to Europe. Nobody ever heard of,
[00:34:29] not one person of you heard of it. And I
[00:34:32] stopped it. It was dead. And then they
[00:34:35] say I'm friends with Putin. I got along
[00:34:37] with him. He respected me. I respected
[00:34:40] him. It would have never happened. But I
[00:34:42] stopped Nordstream, too. When Biden came
[00:34:44] in almost the first week, he approved
[00:34:47] it. He let it be built. And then they
[00:34:50] say that I wasn't tough on Russia. Putin
[00:34:53] said to me, you know, you're not tough
[00:34:54] on Russia. You stopped the biggest, most
[00:34:56] important job we've ever done. You
[00:34:58] stopped it. And Biden came in and he let
[00:35:00] it be built. And I'll tell you what, I I
[00:35:03] will never forget the day I had it
[00:35:05] totally stopped. They weren't building.
[00:35:07] They gave up on it. They weren't able
[00:35:09] to. And then Biden came in and he let
[00:35:11] him build. I couldn't believe it. Okay,
[00:35:13] one or two questions more, please. Any
[00:35:15] questions? Any question for the
[00:35:16] chancellor? Would you like to continue?
[00:35:18] Go ahead. For the chancellor. Um, that
[00:35:21] would be I like his answers much better.
[00:35:23] Well, would you continue to support
[00:35:27] Ukraine? Yeah, I'm I'm with Ukraine. We
[00:35:30] just signed a big deal on rare earth
[00:35:32] with Ukraine. And uh we want I want to
[00:35:35] you know what? I'm I'm for stopping
[00:35:38] killing. Really? That's what I'm for.
[00:35:41] Again, a war that would have never
[00:35:42] started, should have never started. I
[00:35:44] want to see the killing stop. We spent
[00:35:46] $350 billion dollars, much more than
[00:35:49] Europe, but Europe spent a lot also.
[00:35:51] They spent way over a hundred billion.
[00:35:53] Yeah. So, you're talking about close
[00:35:55] to$500 billion dollars went into that
[00:35:57] whole thing. And it's not even the
[00:35:59] money. And and I know with you, too,
[00:36:01] it's it's a lot of money, but it's the
[00:36:04] death that's being caused. We went to
[00:36:06] the Middle East. I went last week to the
[00:36:08] Middle East. We took in 5.1 trillion
[00:36:10] dollars. That's many, many times. That's
[00:36:13] 30 40 times 50 times more than what
[00:36:16] we're talking about. It's 5. Think of
[00:36:19] that. $5.1 trillion of investment with
[00:36:22] one trip that lasted four days. Uh so
[00:36:25] it's not the money. It's a little bit of
[00:36:28] money, but not the money. The big thing,
[00:36:30] the big thing is the death. The death of
[00:36:33] and and really the decimation. You
[00:36:36] you've lost a whole culture. You know,
[00:36:38] Ukraine had the most beautiful turrets.
[00:36:40] They call them turrets. the little
[00:36:41] towers, beautiful towers, the most
[00:36:43] beautiful in the world. They're all now
[00:36:46] laying on their side, blown to
[00:36:48] smitherines. It'll never happen again.
[00:36:50] They've taken away the culture of a of a
[00:36:53] country. They've taken away the heritage
[00:36:55] of a country. It's a terrible thing. But
[00:36:58] most importantly again is the death.
[00:37:01] 5,000 plus people a week, soldiers are
[00:37:04] being killed. He doesn't want that and I
[00:37:06] don't want that. One more table. Thank
[00:37:10] you, Mr. President. Do you support the
[00:37:12] Graham bill on putting high tariffs on
[00:37:15] China? I haven't looked at it, but
[00:37:17] they'll be guided by me. That's the way
[00:37:19] it's supposed to be. They're going to be
[00:37:21] guided by me. No, I haven't looked at
[00:37:22] it. It's a bill on sanctions, etc.
[00:37:25] Uh when it I'm a very quick study. At
[00:37:29] the right time, I'll do what I want to
[00:37:30] do. Uh but it could very well be okay.
[00:37:33] I'll have to see. But uh they're waiting
[00:37:35] for me to decide on what to do. And I'll
[00:37:38] I'll know maybe very soon. It's a harsh
[00:37:41] bill. Yeah, very harsh.
[00:37:45] Take one more. I would like to have a
[00:37:47] question to the chancellor as well
[00:37:48] because um do you agree with the analogy
[00:37:52] the president made on the war between
[00:37:55] Russia and Ukraine as being a fight
[00:37:57] between two kids? Is that how you view
[00:37:59] that as well? And how do you what do you
[00:38:01] actually want the US president to do in
[00:38:04] this? Well, I think we we both agree on
[00:38:07] on this war and how terrible this war is
[00:38:11] going on and we are both looking for uh
[00:38:16] ways to stop it very soon. And uh I I
[00:38:21] told the president before we came in
[00:38:23] that he is the key person in the world
[00:38:26] who can really do that now by putting
[00:38:30] pressure on Russia. And uh we will have
[00:38:33] this debate later on again how we can
[00:38:36] proceed jointly between the Europeans
[00:38:38] and the Americans. And I think we are
[00:38:40] all in we are having the duty to do
[00:38:44] something on that now to stop it after
[00:38:46] three and a half years which is really
[00:38:48] terrible. Look at the kids the the the
[00:38:51] kids which were uh kidnapped from from
[00:38:54] Ukraine to Russia. This is this is all
[00:38:57] terrible. And so we are talking about
[00:38:59] instruments, measures, what we can do.
[00:39:01] And my personal view is clear on that.
[00:39:03] We are on the side of of Ukraine and we
[00:39:05] are trying to get them stronger and
[00:39:07] stronger just to make Putin stop this
[00:39:09] war. And this is our this is our
[00:39:11] approach. We get satellite pictures of
[00:39:12] the warfield. Yeah. And you don't even
[00:39:16] like to look at them, right? It's
[00:39:17] terrible. So it's bodies, arms, heads,
[00:39:21] uh legs, all over the place. You've
[00:39:24] never seen anything like it. It's It's
[00:39:26] so ridiculous. And this is only by
[00:39:29] Russian weapons against Ukraine. This
[00:39:31] had never happened with Ukraine weapons
[00:39:34] against Russia. Never. Ukraine is only
[00:39:37] targeting military targets, not
[00:39:40] civilians, not private, not instrument,
[00:39:43] not energy infrastructure. So this is
[00:39:45] the difference and that's the reason why
[00:39:47] we are trying to do more on Russia, how
[00:39:49] to stop this war. Well, in this case,
[00:39:51] I'm talking about the battlefield. you
[00:39:53] know the soldiers on soldiers but you
[00:39:55] could also say that too with the cities
[00:39:56] you know the cities are being hit also
[00:39:58] so it's a terrible terrible thing one
[00:40:01] somebody said autopen did I hear the
[00:40:02] word autoen because I think it's the
[00:40:05] biggest scandal
[00:40:06] maybe in the last hundred years in this
[00:40:09] country so when I hear that word I think
[00:40:11] it has to be discussed because uh the
[00:40:14] fake news will try and you know hide it
[00:40:16] and we can't do that I'm asking you have
[00:40:18] you uncovered any evidence that anything
[00:40:20] specific was signed without President
[00:40:22] Biden's knowledge or by other people in
[00:40:24] the administration acting illegally.
[00:40:26] Well, I don't think Biden would know
[00:40:28] whether or not he signed it. I'm asking
[00:40:29] if you've uncovered any of that
[00:40:30] information. No, but I I've uncovered,
[00:40:32] you know, the human mind. I was in a
[00:40:34] debate with the human mind and I didn't
[00:40:37] think he knew what the hell he was
[00:40:38] doing. So, you know, it's just one of
[00:40:39] those things, one of those problems. We
[00:40:41] can't we can't ever allow that to happen
[00:40:43] to our country. The danger our country
[00:40:45] was in. And I know some of the people
[00:40:47] that worked with him, radical left,
[00:40:50] horrible people. And I could give you
[00:40:52] the name of some of the people that used
[00:40:53] the autopen because I'm here and I asked
[00:40:56] questions about people that were here
[00:40:57] also. There are a lot of people that
[00:40:59] were here when that happened and they're
[00:41:00] here right now and they'll answer your
[00:41:02] question very accurately. Uh but I know
[00:41:05] some of the people that used that auto
[00:41:07] pen and those are not the people that
[00:41:09] had the same ideology as Joe Biden.
[00:41:12] These were radical left lunatics that
[00:41:14] used that and they didn't get elected.
[00:41:17] He didn't get elected either, actually.
[00:41:19] Thank you very much everybody.
[00:41:23] Thanks guys.
[00:41:26] Thank you
[00:41:28] [Music]
[00:41:36] for everybody.
[00:41:40] I try not to jump.
