[00:00:01] well Zach uh I understand you just got
[00:00:03] back from your test drive on that Camry
[00:00:05] LE what did you think of it I really
[00:00:07] enjoyed the vehicle I think it's
[00:00:09] something that I could see myself taking
[00:00:10] home and to be honest the salesperson
[00:00:12] Frank he was really really great as well
[00:00:15] I I felt comfortable the entire time
[00:00:17] well I'm I'm glad that that Frank made
[00:00:20] you feel comfortable I'm glad that you
[00:00:22] think this is the type of car that you
[00:00:24] could see yourself living with AB um
[00:00:26] it's a great great vehicle you know the
[00:00:29] Camry's been around
[00:00:31] what 30 years it's still one of the most
[00:00:33] popular vehicles that Toyota's ever
[00:00:36] produced and I can I can guarantee it's
[00:00:38] not the type of vehicle that'll ever let
[00:00:40] you down yeah no and and between you and
[00:00:42] me really what it's going to come down
[00:00:44] to yes it's the price you know it's it's
[00:00:46] really the numbers at the end of the day
[00:00:48] cuz I love the car yes I feel ready to
[00:00:50] go home in it w but my wife you know she
[00:00:53] needs to we need to you know we just got
[00:00:55] to make sure everything's in alignment
[00:00:56] before before I walk out do we do we
[00:00:58] need to have your wife here process or
[00:01:02] if you've already you've already got the
[00:01:04] stamp of approval from her to go ahead
[00:01:06] if the numbers are correct she said as
[00:01:08] long as I negotiate a good deal well the
[00:01:11] the wonderful thing about us here at
[00:01:14] gotcha Motors all we're interested in is
[00:01:17] is trying to figure out a way to make
[00:01:18] you a member of the family a member of
[00:01:21] the Goa Motors family okay somebody's
[00:01:23] got to be there I will say one thing and
[00:01:25] what was your name again uh my name's
[00:01:27] Ray Ray I will share one thing with you
[00:01:29] yes so my wife smart lady yeah smart
[00:01:32] enough to marry you smart enough to
[00:01:34] marry me yeah she had me watch these
[00:01:35] YouTube videos all right on how to buy a
[00:01:37] car so I got one question for you before
[00:01:40] we even get into the numbers absolutely
[00:01:41] when you show me a number I want to see
[00:01:43] the out the door price okay none of the
[00:01:46] payments none of the none of the add-ons
[00:01:50] and and crap I need the out the door
[00:01:53] price okay it'd be my pleasure to do
[00:01:56] that for you I've got nothing to hide
[00:01:58] all right okay so the Camry the Le it's
[00:02:02] Bas model I know you loved it I have
[00:02:04] some numbers for you on that vehicle and
[00:02:07] and since you're a bottom line kind of
[00:02:10] guy an otd kind of guy well also known
[00:02:13] as a bottom line kind of guy with the
[00:02:15] outd door number for that vehicle you're
[00:02:18] with taxes fees
[00:02:20] everything you're only looking at $
[00:02:23] 33,6
[00:02:25] 6355 so $
[00:02:28] 33,6 163 .55 is what that's the out the
[00:02:32] door number if I had to write a check
[00:02:34] you write that check you'll go home
[00:02:36] Happy I'll go home
[00:02:38] happy I might plan a
[00:02:40] vacation no I'm just kidding there's I I
[00:02:44] I couldn't take a vacation off of this
[00:02:45] commission all right let's let's let's
[00:02:47] run through there's a lot of line items
[00:02:48] here make up every every car deal has a
[00:02:51] lot of line items so it says market
[00:02:54] value selling price yeah that's the MSRP
[00:02:56] $
[00:02:57] 29,34 exactly yeah Camry's MSRP from the
[00:03:00] factory is 20 okay yes you're giving me
[00:03:03] a discount
[00:03:05] $264 discount I guess I guess you got a
[00:03:07] few cam okay that makes sense I can
[00:03:09] understand you're trying to get a deal
[00:03:10] done yes the price then is
[00:03:28] $227,200 we could wave the freight but
[00:03:30] you had to get the car here doc fee is
[00:03:33] $150 I know you charge everyone the doc
[00:03:36] fee I read something about that yes
[00:03:38] dealer prep yes
[00:03:41] $1,688 yes on the Camry's that's what it
[00:03:44] is now if we were looking at a grand
[00:03:46] Highlander it would be a higher number
[00:03:48] for dealer prep and what does the dealer
[00:03:50] prep mean well it's to get the get the
[00:03:51] vehicle ready for the lot for sale
[00:03:54] safety inspection everything that the
[00:03:55] pre- delivery inspection everything that
[00:03:58] you need to do to have that vehicle be
[00:04:01] 100% ready to
[00:04:03] go for you to take it home do you do
[00:04:06] that to every car got you Motors yeah
[00:04:09] every every car gets gets the dealer
[00:04:11] prep and like I say if now if it was an
[00:04:13] entry level Corolla it would only be
[00:04:16] 1488 being an entry level Camry it's
[00:04:20] 1688 if we were on the grand Highlander
[00:04:22] it's 2488 I had no clue that dealer and
[00:04:26] does do all dealers do that I don't know
[00:04:29] what other deers do I only know what we
[00:04:31] do here I I don't run other shops tax I
[00:04:34] can't negotiate tax that's my sales tax
[00:04:36] you get that viit another tax all right
[00:04:39] I understand license fee and inspection
[00:04:41] fee title fee okay those are all state
[00:04:44] fees we got the pipa new is that is that
[00:04:46] another type of fee that is another
[00:04:48] state fee it's it's yeah it's like an
[00:04:51] environmental fee I okay environmental
[00:04:53] and schme menal cash deposit obviously
[00:04:56] we haven't even talked about that yet so
[00:04:57] we're not going to well because you want
[00:04:58] the out the door number
[00:05:00] you add all that together let me ask you
[00:05:02] a question
[00:05:04] yeah that
[00:05:06] $1,951 125 a tax yes what items on here
[00:05:10] are are are taxable oh
[00:05:16] well yeah the selling price the U the
[00:05:21] freight that's taxable the dealer prep
[00:05:23] is taxable the dock fee is taxable so
[00:05:27] everything above tax is taxable yes is
[00:05:30] that one way I could think about it okay
[00:05:32] how about this yeah you want to sell the
[00:05:34] you want to sell this this car today
[00:05:37] Frank seemed really you know again he
[00:05:39] was kind but he was eager he I could
[00:05:41] tell he hasn't sold a car in a while
[00:05:43] Frank's knew all right well that could
[00:05:45] explain a few things yes yes but of
[00:05:47] course I mean you know the only reason
[00:05:49] we're here Zach is is is to figure out
[00:05:52] how to sell a car in a daily base this
[00:05:53] is no good to sit here and try and
[00:05:57] figure something out where we don't sell
[00:05:59] you the I asked what's what's taxed is
[00:06:01] because if it's taxable it's negotiable
[00:06:05] and when I look at this out the door
[00:06:06] quot yeah go ahead you're actually
[00:06:09] charging me a lot more than
[00:06:12] MSRP a lot more than MSRP like2 or
[00:06:16] $3,000 over MSRP and I can't really wrap
[00:06:19] my head around the fact that the freight
[00:06:20] is almost
[00:06:21] $2,100 I'm pretty sure on the window
[00:06:24] sticker it showed Freight as part of Y
[00:06:26] all have it as market value selling
[00:06:28] price but as the MSRP I'm pretty sure
[00:06:30] you're trying to charge me twice for
[00:06:32] that and now that I think of it yes
[00:06:35] gotta
[00:06:37] Motors you're trying to Goa
[00:06:42] me that's unique but no we're just
[00:06:46] trying to get you because our slogan
[00:06:49] here at gotcha Motors is once we get you
[00:06:52] we got
[00:06:53] you so yeah that's exactly Ray can you
[00:06:57] can you in all seriousness yes
[00:07:00] I appreciate the first pass I appreciate
[00:07:02] that you you even put a discount on here
[00:07:04] of course let's run it back I can't walk
[00:07:07] out of here paying over MSRP I know that
[00:07:09] there was a shortage of vehicles I saw
[00:07:11] it in the YouTube videos I get it we're
[00:07:12] not in those times anymore I could
[00:07:14] probably go down the street to the other
[00:07:15] dealer not have to play any of these
[00:07:16] games they give me an otd at MSRP i' be
[00:07:18] a happy camper they they might
[00:07:21] play other games I don't know I
[00:07:23] understand I understand but I'm here I
[00:07:25] want to buy the car okay and I
[00:07:27] appreciate that so let me ask you a
[00:07:28] question all right um you feel as if
[00:07:32] we're charging you over MSRP you all
[00:07:34] your I don't feel that way R the numbers
[00:07:37] the numbers are the numbers all all
[00:07:39] you're concerned with is the out the
[00:07:40] door number so right now the out the
[00:07:42] door number is $
[00:07:44] 33,6
[00:07:47] 6355 what is it that you had in mind
[00:07:49] that would be uh uh compelling enough
[00:07:52] for you to go home with the vehicle 33
[00:07:56] 66355 and you're telling me to tell you
[00:07:58] what I think should be I I need you I I
[00:08:02] I'm getting the sense that you want me
[00:08:04] to do something for you yeah I need to
[00:08:06] know what it is you'd like me to do um
[00:08:09] you know because if you're just going to
[00:08:10] ask me you say well uh Ray could you
[00:08:13] take a few dollars off well so if I take
[00:08:16] a few dollars off is that going to be
[00:08:18] enough to get you to say yes but the
[00:08:20] easiest way to find that is what numers
[00:08:23] doesn't need to be in order for that to
[00:08:25] possibly happen and I'll let you know
[00:08:27] whether or not that's doable I can
[00:08:29] appreciate that I can assure you of two
[00:08:31] things yeah one is I'm not paying over
[00:08:34] MSRP I I get that I so use that use that
[00:08:37] as a barometer okay for the next the
[00:08:39] next pass the second thing the second
[00:08:41] thing I'll mention yeah I actually have
[00:08:43] a trade in I wasn't going to bring it up
[00:08:45] but I'll bring it up now I have a trade
[00:08:46] in and I know that's valuable to you all
[00:08:48] here because that means you get another
[00:08:49] card that you can go sell you don't have
[00:08:50] to worry about going to the auction and
[00:08:52] all that so I have a trade in okay so
[00:08:54] I'll lay that card on the table here for
[00:08:56] you yeah I don't want to pay over MSRP
[00:08:58] and I have a trade can you take that to
[00:09:00] your manager and tell me what we can do
[00:09:01] forget about the trade at the moment
[00:09:04] okay I and I appreciate the fact that
[00:09:06] you have a trade but what what did you
[00:09:08] want that out the door number to be give
[00:09:10] me some I I'm not going to go into my
[00:09:13] manager and say uh boss he wants it to
[00:09:16] be cheaper and then my boss is going to
[00:09:19] say to me okay R so he wants it to be
[00:09:22] cheaper how much cheaper does he want it
[00:09:24] to be well I don't know boss he wouldn't
[00:09:25] share that with me um so you know why
[00:09:28] don't get where you're coming why don't
[00:09:30] we just take like a wild ass stab at it
[00:09:33] and see if maybe we come up with the
[00:09:34] right number no I need to go in there
[00:09:37] and and be able to give them some idea
[00:09:41] as to what you're hoping to get I got to
[00:09:43] be under $30,000 out there so so so if
[00:09:47] it's a
[00:09:50] $29,999
[00:09:52] 199 we've got a deal I'm probably still
[00:09:55] going to jerk you around a little bit so
[00:09:58] so give me you know I I want to be able
[00:10:00] to go to my boss give me a decent amount
[00:10:02] under 30,000 what to find decent decent
